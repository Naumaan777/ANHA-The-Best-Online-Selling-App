# E-Commerce Platform

This is a React application that simulates a basic e-commerce platform. The application demonstrates the use of React components, state management with Redux, routing with react-router, and API integration.

## Features

- **Redux for State Management**: The application uses Redux for state management. Alternatively, React's Context API can be used.

- **Header**: The header displays a navigation bar with links to Home, Cart, and (optional) About pages.

- **Home**: The home page displays a list of products. Each product has a title, image, price, and an "Add to Cart" button.

- **ProductPage**: This page displays detailed information about a single product. This page is accessible by clicking on a product in the Home page.

- **Cart**: The cart page displays the items added to the cart. Each item has a title, price, and a "Remove from Cart" button.

## Routes

- `/product/:id`: This route loads the ProductPage component, where :id is the dynamic parameter representing the product ID.

- `/cart`: This route loads the Cart component.

The Header component is always visible at the top of the page, regardless of which route is active.

## State Management

The application uses Redux or React's Context API to manage the application's state, particularly for storing and updating the items in the cart. Actions and reducers (if using Redux) or a context provider (if using Context API) are implemented to handle adding and removing items from the cart.
